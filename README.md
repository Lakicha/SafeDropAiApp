# SafeDropAiApp
AI rider and shop safety tool for online deliveries
SafeDropAiApp helps shops and delivery riders stay safe during online deliveries. The app verifies buyers before dispatch and gives riders safety support during delivery. The goal is to reduce attacks, fraud, and losses.
Problem
Delivery riders and small businesses face real danger from fake buyers. Many orders come from unverified phone numbers and false locations. Riders arrive without knowing who they are meeting. When attacks happen, there is no digital record to help investigations.
Solution
SafeDropAiApp verifies buyers before delivery and supports rider safety during drop-off. The system creates a clear record of each order and gives shops the confidence to dispatch safely.
Key Features
• Buyer identity check using selfie and phone number
• Liveness check to stop fake photos
• Location confirmation before dispatch
• Risk score to guide dispatch decisions
• Rider safety alerts and check-in flow
• Digital records for follow-up
How It Works

1. A shop creates a delivery order.


2. The system sends a verification link to the buyer.


3. The buyer completes identity and location checks.


4. The system reviews the details and assigns a risk level.


5. The shop decides whether to dispatch.


6. The rider follows safety steps during delivery.
